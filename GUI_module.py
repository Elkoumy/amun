In this file, we implement the GUI functionality required from the project. The project performs the following functionalities:
    * Reading the event logs as XES or reading DFGs.
    * Take either delta as input or accuracy as input.
    * Report the epsilon, delta and accuracy.
    * Plot the DFG for both cases.
    * export the DFG after applying the differential privacy.
